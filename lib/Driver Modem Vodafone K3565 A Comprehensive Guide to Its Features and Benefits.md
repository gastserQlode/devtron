The Vodafone Mobile Broadband app for Windows 10 helps you manage your mobile world. You can access your online account, get messages, and find help and support. You can also check your data usage, top up your data allowance, and send and receive SMS text messages.
 
## Step 1: Plug in your USB Stick
 
When you plug your USB Stick into a USB socket on your Windows 10 device, Windows will usually recognise it and open a mobile broadband connection as soon as possible. However, if your USB Stick is not directly supported by Windows 10, you need to install the Vodafone Mobile Broadband software from it onto your device.
 
To do this, plug your USB Stick into your device, run the installer that appears, and follow the on-screen instructions. This will allow Windows 10 to manage your USB Stick.
 
## Step 2: Download the Vodafone Mobile Broadband app for Windows 10
 
Although Windows 10 can recognise and manage many Vodafone Mobile Broadband devices, we also offer an additional app specifically for Windows 10. You can download this app from the Microsoft Store.

Deep Freeze is a software program that prevents any permanent changes from being made to a computer. Deep Freeze consists of two states: Frozen and Thawed. When Deep Freeze is in a Frozen state, any changes made to the computer are forgotten when the computer is restarted. When Deep Freeze is in a Thawed state, any changes made to the computer are saved. Deep Freeze is useful for cases in which you don't wish to make permanent changes to your system or the documents stored on it[^4^].

Here are some more paragraphs for your article:
 
Deep Freeze is a powerful tool that can protect your computer from malware, viruses, and unwanted changes. However, it also has some limitations and drawbacks. For example, Deep Freeze does not allow you to save any files or documents on your computer unless you switch to the Thawed state. This means that you will lose any work that you have done in the Frozen state if you forget to save it or transfer it to an external device. Also, Deep Freeze does not update your system automatically, so you will need to manually install Windows and other software updates in the Thawed state.
 
Another issue with Deep Freeze is that it can be difficult to uninstall. If you want to remove Deep Freeze from your computer, you will need to disable it first by entering the Thawed state and selecting the option "Boot Thawed" from the settings. Then, you will need to run the installer file again and select the option "Uninstall". This will remove Deep Freeze from your computer and restore it to its original state. However, if you lose or forget your password, you will not be able to access the settings or uninstall Deep Freeze. In that case, you will need to contact Faronics, the company that develops Deep Freeze, for assistance.

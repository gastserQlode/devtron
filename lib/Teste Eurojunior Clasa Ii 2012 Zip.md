The contest was initiated in 2003 by the OLIMP Association, a non-governmental organization that promotes education and culture. The contest is supported by the Ministry of Education and Research, the Romanian Academy, and other institutions and partners.
 
The contest consists of two stages: a local stage and a national stage. The local stage is organized by the county school inspectorates and involves the participation of students from all schools in each county. The best students from each county qualify for the national stage, which is organized by the OLIMP Association in Bucharest. The national stage involves written tests, oral presentations, and cultural activities. The winners of the national stage receive diplomas, medals, books, and other prizes.
 
The Eurojunior contest is a great opportunity for students to develop their cognitive abilities, creativity, and communication skills. It also encourages them to discover new domains of knowledge and culture and to interact with other students from different regions of Romania. The contest fosters a spirit of competition, cooperation, and friendship among the participants and contributes to their personal and academic growth.

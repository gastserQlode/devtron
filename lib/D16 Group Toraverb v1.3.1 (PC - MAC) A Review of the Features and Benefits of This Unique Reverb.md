D16 Group Toraverb v1.3.1 features two independent reverb engines that can be blended together or used separately. Each engine has its own set of parameters, such as pre-delay, decay time, diffusion, damping, modulation rate and depth, and EQ. You can also adjust the stereo width and cross-feedback of each engine, as well as the global dry/wet mix and output level.
 
One of the most unique features of D16 Group Toraverb v1.3.1 is the modulation section, which allows you to apply LFOs to various aspects of the reverb tail, such as amplitude, frequency, or phase. This can create subtle or dramatic variations in the reverb sound, adding movement, shimmer, or glitch effects. You can also sync the LFOs to your host tempo or use them in free mode.
 
Another distinctive feature of D16 Group Toraverb v1.3.1 is the spatial reflection algorithm, which simulates the reflections of sound waves from the walls of a virtual room. You can control the size and shape of the room, as well as the distance and position of the sound source and the listener. This can create realistic or surreal spatial effects, depending on how you tweak the parameters.
 
D16 Group Toraverb v1.3.1 is compatible with both PC and MAC platforms, and supports VST, AU, and AAX formats. It has a simple and intuitive interface that lets you access all the controls easily and quickly. It also comes with a variety of presets that showcase the plugin's capabilities and inspire you to create your own sounds.

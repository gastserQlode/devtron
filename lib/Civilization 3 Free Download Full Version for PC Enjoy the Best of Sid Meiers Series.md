4. Once the download is complete, you will need to extract or mount the game files. If you downloaded the ISO Image format, you will need a software like Daemon Tools or PowerISO to mount the disc image file as a virtual drive. If you downloaded the ZIP file format, you will need a software like WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract the game files to a folder. If you downloaded the Torrent file format, you will need a software like uTorrent or BitTorrent to open the file and download the game files.
5. After extracting or mounting the game files, you will need to install the game. To do this, open the folder or drive where the game files are located and run the setup.exe file. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation.

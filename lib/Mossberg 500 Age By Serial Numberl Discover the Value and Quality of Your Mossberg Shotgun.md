# How to Find Out the Age of Your Mossberg 500 Shotgun
 
Mossberg 500 is a series of pump action shotguns that have been in production since 1961. They are popular among hunters, law enforcement, and military personnel for their reliability and low cost. But how can you tell how old your Mossberg 500 shotgun is? Here are some tips to help you find out.
 
The first thing you need to do is locate the serial number of your shotgun. Mossberg serial numbers are typically 7-characters long, consisting of a letter prefix and then 6 numbers, like this: A123456 or Z654321. The letter prefix indicates the model of the shotgun, while the numbers indicate the order of production. For example, A000001 would be the first Mossberg 500 ever made, while Z999999 would be the last one in that series.

However, not all Mossberg 500 shotguns have serial numbers. Before 1968, there was no federal law requiring firearms to have serial numbers, so some older models may not have them. If your shotgun does not have a serial number, you will have to rely on other clues to determine its age, such as the features, markings, and design of the shotgun.
 
One way to narrow down the age of your shotgun is to compare it with the different models and variations of the Mossberg 500 series. Some of the most common models are:
 
- 500: The original and most basic model of the series. It has a plain barrel, a wooden stock and forearm, a receiver safety, and a bead sight. It can chamber 12 gauge, 20 gauge, or .410 bore shells.
- 505: A youth model with a shorter length of pull and barrel length. It is similar to the 500, but only comes in 20 gauge or .410 bore.
- 510: A mini model with an even shorter length of pull and barrel length. It is designed for young shooters and comes in 20 gauge or .410 bore.
- 535: A magnum model that can chamber 2.75 inch, 3 inch, or 3.5 inch shells. It has a synthetic stock and forearm, a vent rib barrel, and an interchangeable choke system.
- 590: A tactical model that has a thicker barrel, an extended magazine tube, a heat shield, a bayonet lug, and ghost ring sights. It is used by the US military and law enforcement.

You can also look for other features that may indicate the age of your shotgun, such as:

- The type of safety: The original Mossberg 500 had a tang safety on top of the receiver. In 1986, Mossberg introduced a cross-bolt safety on the trigger guard for some models.
- The type of finish: The early Mossberg 500 had a blued finish on the metal parts. In 1987, Mossberg started using a parkerized finish for some models.
- The type of stock: The early Mossberg 500 had a wooden stock and forearm. In 1973, Mossberg started using checkered pistol grip stocks for some models. In the late 1980s, Mossberg started using synthetic stocks for some models.

If you have the serial number of your shotgun, you can also try to contact Mossberg customer service or visit their website to see if they can provide you with more information about your shotgun's history and manufacture date. You can also check online forums or databases where other Mossberg owners may have shared their serial numbers and dates.
 
By following these steps, you should be able to find out the age of your Mossberg 500 shotgun with some degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that there may be some exceptions or variations that may not fit into these general guidelines. The best way to confirm the age of your shotgun is to consult an expert or a reliable source.

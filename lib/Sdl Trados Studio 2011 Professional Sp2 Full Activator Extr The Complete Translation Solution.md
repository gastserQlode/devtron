- Source segment editing: You can edit the source segments in your translation projects, either manually or using Track Changes.

You can also add comments to the source segments to communicate with your clients or reviewers[^1^] [^4^].
- Auto-propagation review: You can review and confirm the auto-propagated segments in your translation projects, either individually or in batches. This can help you ensure consistency and accuracy across your translations. You can also filter the auto-propagated segments by different criteria, such as match value, repetition type, or confirmation status[^2^].
- Cloud terminology: You can access and manage your terminology online using Trados Terminology, a cloud-based solution that comes with Trados Studio or via subscription. You can share your termbases with your colleagues and external freelancers, and import and export them to and from Excel. You can also use Trados Terminology as a standalone application or integrate it with other SDL products[^1^].
- Neural machine translation: You can use Language Weaver, a state-of-the-art neural machine translation (NMT) solution, to automatically translate your content. You can customize your NMT engines for specific domains, languages, and quality levels. You can also post-edit and evaluate the NMT output within Trados Studio[^1^].

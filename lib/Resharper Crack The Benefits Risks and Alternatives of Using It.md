## How does ReSharper help Visual Studio users?
 
ReSharper adds a lot of functionality to Visual Studio that makes coding more productive and enjoyable. Here are some of the ways ReSharper can help you:
 
- **Analyze code quality:** ReSharper performs over 2200 code inspections for various issues and suggests quick-fixes to solve them. You can see the code analysis results in the editor, in the solution explorer, or in a dedicated tool window. You can also run code analysis on the whole solution or on specific files or folders.
- **Eliminate errors and code smells:** ReSharper not only warns you when there is a problem in your code but also provides hundreds of quick-fixes to solve them automatically. You can apply quick-fixes with a single keystroke or choose from multiple options. You can also use context actions to perform small transformations on your code.
- **Safely change the code base:** ReSharper offers 60+ refactorings and 450+ context actions that help you safely change your code structure and logic. You can rename symbols, extract methods, introduce variables, move types or members, inline expressions, and much more. ReSharper takes care of updating all the references and preserving the code semantics.
- **Instantly traverse the entire solution:** ReSharper helps you navigate and search through your code base with ease. You can jump to any file, type, or member in your solution or go to its usages, base or derived symbols, or implementations. You can also find and highlight all occurrences of a symbol in the current file or use structural search and replace to find complex patterns.
- **Enjoy code editing helpers:** ReSharper enhances the Visual Studio editor with extended IntelliSense, code templates, parameter info, documentation pop-ups, import assistance, code rearrangement, and other features that make coding faster and easier.
- **Comply with coding standards:** ReSharper helps you maintain a consistent code style and formatting across your team. You can configure and apply code style settings for various aspects of your code such as naming, spacing, braces, indentation, etc. You can also use code cleanup to automatically format and optimize your code according to your preferences.

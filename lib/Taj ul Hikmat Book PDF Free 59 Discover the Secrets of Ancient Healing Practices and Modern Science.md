Taj ul Hikmat is a must-read book for anyone who wants to learn about the ancient wisdom of Tibb and Hikmat and benefit from its practical applications.
  
Tibb and Hikmat are based on the concept of four humors or akhlat: blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. These humors correspond to the four elements of nature: air, water, fire, and earth. The balance of these humors in the body determines the health and temperament of a person. Any imbalance or excess of a humor causes disease and disorder. Tibb and Hikmat aim to restore the balance of the humors by using natural substances such as herbs, minerals, animal products, and foods. They also prescribe certain exercises, massages, baths, and lifestyle changes to enhance the well-being of a person.

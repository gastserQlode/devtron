Since his death, the group has released cracked games less frequently, focusing more on DRM-free titles from GOG.com, as well as games for Linux and macOS platforms.
  
The group has also been involved in various legal disputes and controversies over the years. In 2004, they were sued by the Entertainment Software Association for distributing a cracked version of Half-Life 2 before its official release.[29] The lawsuit was settled out of court in 2006, with the group agreeing to cease distributing any ESA member's copyrighted works.[30] In 2009, they were accused by Ubisoft of stealing a pre-release copy of Assassin's Creed from their servers and releasing it online.[31] The group denied the accusation and claimed that they obtained the copy from a retail source.[32]

Despite their reduced activity and legal troubles, the group has maintained a loyal fan base and a reputation as one of the most skilled and influential cracking groups in the history of the scene. They have received numerous awards and recognitions from various scene-related websites and magazines, such as being voted as the best cracking group of 2007 by GameCopyWorld,[33] and being inducted into the Hall of Fame by Defacto2.net in 2011.[34] They have also inspired other groups and individuals to follow their example and challenge the anti-piracy measures of game developers and publishers.
  
The group has also faced some internal conflicts and rivalries over the years. In 2007, they had a dispute with another cracking group, RELOADED, over the proper way to crack SecuROM, a popular copy protection scheme at the time.[35] The dispute escalated into a war of words and releases, with both groups claiming to have the superior method and accusing each other of stealing and sabotaging their work.[36] The conflict was eventually resolved in 2008, with both groups agreeing to respect each other's work and cooperate on future releases.[37]
  
The group has also been known for their humorous and witty release notes and nfo files, which often contain jokes, riddles, trivia, quotes, and references to pop culture and other scene-related topics. Some of their release notes have become famous and memorable among the scene community, such as their "RazorDOX" series, which parodied the Matrix movies,[38] their "Razor1911 vs. The World" series, which mocked various game developers and publishers,[39] and their "Razor1911: The Musical" series, which featured original songs and lyrics based on popular tunes.[40]

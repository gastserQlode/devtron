## Step 2: Enter or import component data
 
To create a footprint and a 3D model, you need to enter or import the component data into PCB Library Expert. You can do this in several ways:

- Manually enter the component dimensions using the graphical user interface.
- Import the component data from a datasheet or a PDF file using the OCR feature.
- Import the component data from an existing footprint file using the Reverse Engineer feature.
- Import the component data from Parts on Demand database using the POD feature (Enterprise Edition only).

PCB Library Expert supports various types of components, such as SMD, through-hole, BGA, QFN, SOIC, etc. You can select the component type from the drop-down menu and fill in the required fields. You can also use the Librarian Tools to save, edit, categorize, and output your component data as FPX files.
 
## Step 3: Generate footprint and 3D model
 
After entering or importing the component data, you can generate the footprint and the 3D model by clicking on the Generate button. PCB Library Expert will automatically calculate and generate high-quality footprints and 3D models based on IPC standards or your own preferences. You can view the footprint and the 3D model in separate windows, and zoom in or out, rotate, pan, or measure them. You can also modify any parameter of the footprint or the 3D model using the Edit button.
 
## Step 4: Export to your preferred CAD format
 
Once you are satisfied with your footprint and 3D model, you can export them to your preferred CAD format by clicking on the Export button. PCB Library Expert supports 25 CAD formats, such as Allegro, Altium Designer, Eagle, KiCad, OrCAD Layout, PADS Standard, Proteus, etc. You can select your CAD tool from the drop-down menu and choose a destination folder for your output files. You can also export multiple footprints and 3D models at

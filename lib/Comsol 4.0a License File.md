## What Is a Comsol 4.0a License File?
 
A Comsol 4.0a license file is a text file that contains information about your Comsol license, such as the license number, expiration date, product modules, and host name and ID of the machine that runs the license manager. The license file has a .dat extension and is usually named comsol.dat.
 
The license file is required for running Comsol Multiphysics on your network via floating network licenses (FNL) or academic server licenses (ASL). These are concurrent licenses that allow multiple users to access Comsol Multiphysics simultaneously on computers within the network on which the license manager is running. The license manager is software that enables the use of Comsol Multiphysics on your network and communicates with the Comsol server to verify your license status.
 
If you are running Comsol Multiphysics on a Linux operating system, the license manager is always required, regardless of license type. The license manager is also required in some other cases; refer to the Installation Guide for more information.

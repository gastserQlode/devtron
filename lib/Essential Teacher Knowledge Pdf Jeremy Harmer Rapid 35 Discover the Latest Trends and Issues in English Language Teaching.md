In this article, we will review the main features of Essential Teacher Knowledge, its strengths and weaknesses, and its suitability for different types of teachers and learners.
 
## What is Essential Teacher Knowledge?
 
Essential Teacher Knowledge is a foundation-level methodology book that consists of 110 two-page units, each focusing on a specific topic or aspect of language teaching. The units are organized into seven sections:
 
- Section A: Language - This section covers the basics of grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation and discourse analysis.
- Section B: Background to Language Teaching Methodology - This section introduces the main approaches and methods in language teaching history and current practice.
- Section C: Teaching Language and Language Skills - This section deals with how to teach the four skills (listening, speaking, reading and writing), as well as grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation.
- Section D: Managing Learning and Teaching - This section explores how to create a positive learning environment, give instructions, correct errors, use group work and pair work, and deal with classroom problems.
- Section E: Planning, Resources and Assessment - This section explains how to plan lessons and courses, use textbooks and other materials, design tasks and activities, and assess learners' progress and achievement.
- Section F: Teaching Young Learners - This section focuses on the specific needs and characteristics of young learners (aged 6-12), and how to adapt teaching methods and materials accordingly.
- Section G: CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) - This section introduces the concept of CLIL, which involves teaching content subjects (such as science or history) through the medium of a foreign language.

The book is written in clear and simple English, with plenty of examples, diagrams, tables and charts to illustrate the points. Each unit also has a "Revise", "Research" or "Reflect" activity at the end, which encourages readers to review their learning, find out more information or think critically about the topic. The book also comes with a PIN code that gives access to extra online material, such as audio files for pronunciation practice, downloadable activities for further practice or extension, more video clips of teachers' voices from different contexts, and an up-to-date bibliography for further reading.

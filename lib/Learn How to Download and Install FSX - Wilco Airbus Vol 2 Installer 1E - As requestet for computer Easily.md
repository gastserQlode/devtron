1. Locate the setup file for FSX or the addon. It might be on a CD-ROM or a downloaded file.
2. Right-click on the setup file and choose "Run as Administrator" from the menu. This will give the installer the necessary permissions to modify your system files.
3. When the installer asks you to choose a destination folder, do not accept the default option. Instead, create a new folder on your hard drive (for example, c:\FSX) and select it as the destination. This will prevent any potential conflicts with Windows security features.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for each addon you want to install.
5. When you want to run FSX, find the fsx.exe file in the folder where you installed it (for example, c:\FSX).
6. Right-click on the fsx.exe file and select "Properties" from the menu.
7. Go to the "Compatibility" tab and check the box that says "Run as Administrator". This will ensure that FSX can access all the files and settings it needs.
8. Click "OK" to save the changes and close the properties window.
9. Double-click on the fsx.exe file to launch FSX.

Running FSX and its addons as Administrator is important because they need to access and modify some system files and registry entries that are normally protected by Windows. If you do not run them as Administrator, you might encounter errors, crashes, or missing features.

Installing FSX and its addons in a separate folder from the default one is also recommended because Windows has some security features that might interfere with them. For example, Windows might prevent some files from being written or modified in the Program Files folder, or it might require your permission every time you run FSX. By installing them in a different folder, you can avoid these issues and have more control over your FSX installation.
 
Following these steps will help you install and run FSX and its addons smoothly and enjoy the best flight simulation experience possible. If you have any questions or problems, you can visit the official FSX website or forums for more information and support.

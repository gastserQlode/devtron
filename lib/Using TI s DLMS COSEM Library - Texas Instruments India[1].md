DLMS/COSEM is a set of standards and protocols that enable interoperability and communication between smart meters and other devices in the smart grid. DLMS stands for Device Language Message Specification, which defines the application layer protocol for data exchange. COSEM stands for Companion Specification for Energy Metering, which defines the data model and identification system for metering applications.
 
DLMS/COSEM is widely adopted and recognized as an international standard by various organizations, such as IEC, CEN, and IEEE. DLMS/COSEM supports various communication media and technologies, such as G3-PLC, ZigBee, M-Bus, and GSM. DLMS/COSEM also provides security features, such as encryption, authentication, and access control, to protect the data and devices from unauthorized access or tampering.
 
By using DLMS/COSEM, smart metering stakeholders can benefit from several advantages, such as:
 
- Reduced costs and complexity of system integration and maintenance
- Increased flexibility and scalability of system design and deployment
- Improved data quality and accuracy of meter readings and billing
- Enhanced customer service and satisfaction
- Facilitated innovation and development of new services and applications

If you want to learn more about DLMS/COSEM and how to implement it in your smart metering projects, you can visit the DLMS website or contact the DLMS UA. You can also find other documents related to DLMS/COSEM on the website, such as the Green Book, the Yellow Book, the White Book, and the Blue Book PDF 19.

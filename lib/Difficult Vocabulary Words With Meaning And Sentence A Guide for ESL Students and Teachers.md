1. Use flashcards. Flashcards are a simple and effective way to review and recall new words. You can make your own flashcards with paper or use online tools like Quizlet or Anki. On one side of the card, write the word and its definition. On the other side, write a sentence using the word in context. Review your flashcards regularly and test yourself on both sides.
2. Read extensively. Reading is one of the best ways to expose yourself to a wide range of vocabulary words in different contexts. Choose texts that are interesting and appropriate for your level. As you read, try to guess the meaning of unfamiliar words from the context clues. You can also look up the words in a dictionary or use a browser extension like Google Dictionary to get instant definitions.
3. Listen actively. Listening is another great way to improve your vocabulary skills. You can listen to podcasts, audiobooks, songs, movies, or TV shows in your target language. Pay attention to how the words are pronounced and used in sentences. You can also repeat the words aloud or write them down to reinforce your memory.
4. Use mnemonics. Mnemonics are memory techniques that help you remember information by associating it with something else. For example, you can use acronyms, rhymes, images, stories, or jokes to remember difficult words. For instance, to remember the word "abhor", which means to hate or detest something, you can think of a sentence like "I abhor a bore".
5. Practice writing and speaking. Finally, the best way to master difficult vocabulary words is to use them in your own writing and speaking. You can write essays, stories, journals, or emails using the new words you have learned. You can also practice speaking with native speakers, language partners, or online tutors. Try to use the words in natural and appropriate situations and get feedback on your usage.

By following these tips, you can learn difficult vocabulary words with meaning and sentence examples and expand your language skills. Remember that learning vocabulary is a continuous process that requires regular practice and review. Happy learning!
  
Now that you have learned some tips on how to learn difficult vocabulary words with meaning and sentence examples, you might be wondering how to find such words in the first place. Here are some sources that you can use to discover new and challenging words:

- Word lists. There are many word lists available online or in books that can help you learn specific vocabulary for different purposes. For example, you can find word lists for academic writing, business communication, standardized tests, or specific topics. You can also create your own word lists based on your interests and goals.
- Thesaurus. A thesaurus is a tool that shows you synonyms and antonyms of words. You can use a thesaurus to find more precise or varied ways to express yourself. For example, instead of saying "good", you can say "excellent", "superb", "outstanding", or "splendid". However, be careful not to use words that are too obscure or inappropriate for the context.
- Word of the day. Many websites and apps offer a word of the day feature that introduces you to a new and interesting word every day. You can subscribe to these services and learn a new word every day with its definition, pronunciation, and example sentences. You can also try to use the word of the day in your own writing or speaking.

By using these sources, you can find difficult vocabulary words with meaning and sentence examples and enrich your language learning experience. Remember that quality is more important than quantity when it comes to vocabulary. Focus on learning the words that are relevant and useful for you and review them frequently. Good luck!

## How to Use Ultimate Maps Downloader
 
Ultimate Maps Downloader has a user-friendly interface that is divided into multiple tabs: Home, Map, Location, and Markers and Routes. Here are the main steps to use the software:
 
1. Download and install Ultimate Maps Downloader from [the official website](https://lizard-labs.com/ultimate_maps_downloader.aspx). You can try it for free for 15 days.
2. Launch the software and go to the Home tab. Here you can define the exact geographical coordinates for the two opposite corners of the area you want to download. You can also use the Map tab to zoom in or out of the map and select a location by clicking on it.
3. Choose the desired servers from which you want to download the map imagery. You can select multiple servers and compare them side by side.
4. Pick the zoom level that suits your needs. The higher the zoom level, the more detailed the map will be, but also the more tiles it will require.
5. Provide a name for the map project and click on Download. The software will start downloading the small tiles and saving them on your disk.
6. After the download is complete, you can view the map in the software or export it to JPG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, or BMP file format. You can also create ESRI Word files (JGW) for each downloaded image/tile or generate a plain text file with the latitude and longitude coordinates for each tile.
7. You can also use the Location tab to view information about the selected location on the map (latitude and longitude coordinates), zoom to a user-defined location, copy the information about the location to the clipboard, and add markers.
8. You can also use the Markers and Routes tab to insert places of interests (POIs) on the map by assigning to each one a name and icon and altering the latitude and longitude data, find nearest venues and tips from Foursquare, create a route by specifying the start point and adding additional points to the route, measure distances from one selected point on the map to another and calculate routes.

Malavikagnimitra is not only a romantic comedy, but also a historical drama that depicts some events of the reign of Pushyamitra Shunga, the founder of the Shunga dynasty in India. The play mentions his Rajasuya sacrifice and his victory over the Yavanas (Greeks). The play also showcases the cultural and artistic achievements of the Shunga period, such as music, dance, painting, and sculpture.
 
The play is also notable for its portrayal of women characters, who are not passive or submissive, but active and assertive. The chief queen Dharini is jealous and proud, but also generous and forgiving. She challenges the king's authority and even imprisons Malavika, but later accepts her as a co-wife when she learns her true identity. Malavika is not only beautiful and talented, but also courageous and clever. She escapes from her captors and disguises herself as a maid. She also expresses her love for Agnimitra through subtle hints and gestures. The other female characters, such as Iravati, Bakulavalika, and Kaumudika, also display their wit and charm.

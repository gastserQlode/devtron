Data loss on your Android device can be caused by various reasons, such as accidental deletion, formatting, factory reset, virus attack, system crash, rooting error, etc. To avoid data loss on your Android device, you should follow these tips:

- Back up your data regularly. You can use the built-in backup feature of your device or a third-party app to back up your data to your computer or cloud service. You can also use EaseUS MobiSaver for Android to back up your data to your computer.
- Use a reliable antivirus app to protect your device from malware or viruses. You should also avoid downloading apps from unknown sources or clicking suspicious links.
- Use a password or lock screen pattern to secure your device from unauthorized access. You should also enable the Find My Device feature to locate or erase your device remotely in case of theft or loss.
- Avoid rooting your device unless you know what you are doing. Rooting can give you more control over your device, but it can also void your warranty and expose your device to risks.
